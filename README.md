## Prerequisites

1. **Flutter SDK** (v3.x or newer recommended).
2. **Android Studio** or **Visual Studio Code** (optional, but recommended).
3. **Spotify Developer Account** to obtain **Client ID** and **Client Secret** if you plan to use Spotify search.
4. (Optional) **.env File** using [flutter_dotenv](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dotenv).

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hassan220022/LyriMate.git
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. **Create/Update the `.env` File (Optional)**  
   - In the project root, create a new `.env` file:
     ```dotenv
     SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
     SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
     ```
   - Ensure `.env` is ignored in your `.gitignore` if you don’t want to commit your secrets.

3. **Install Packages**  
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Configure SpotifyService**  
   - In `lib/services/spotify_service.dart`, confirm your environment variables or update the client ID/secret directly.

---

## Running the App

1. **Connect a Device/Emulator**  
   - Ensure at least one device is available:
     ```bash
     flutter devices
     ```
2. **Run the App**  
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   - Or specify a device:
     ```bash
     flutter run -d <deviceId>
     ```
   - This will launch the **Home Screen** of the app.

## Usage Guide

### Searching Tracks

1. On the **Home Screen**, enter a **song title** or **artist name** in the search field.
2. Tap the **search icon** or press **Enter**.  
3. The app shows a list of matching tracks from Spotify:
   - Each list item displays the track name, artist name, and album art thumbnail.

### Viewing Lyrics

1. Tap on any track to go to the **Detail Screen**.
2. The app automatically fetches lyrics from **Lyrics.ovh**.
3. If found, lyrics are displayed line-by-line in a scrollable view.
   - If lyrics appear to be mostly in a right-to-left script (e.g., Arabic), they are displayed in RTL alignment automatically.
4. If lyrics are unavailable, an error message is shown.

### Dark/Light Mode Toggling

- In the **AppBar** on the Home Screen, you’ll see an icon (`moon` or `sun`).
- Tapping this icon **toggles** between **dark mode** and **light mode** across the entire app.
- The current theme mode is retained for the duration of the session. (To persist across restarts, you’d need additional logic.)

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No Results** when searching:
  - Verify your Spotify credentials.
  - Check your internet connection.
  - Double-check your search query.
- **Lyrics Not Found**:
  - Lyrics.ovh may not have every track. Try another song.
- **App Build Errors**:
  - Ensure you’ve run `flutter pub get` after cloning.
  - Make sure your Flutter SDK is installed correctly.
- **Dark Mode Not Toggling**:
  - Confirm you’re running the updated `home_screen.dart` with the icon button in the AppBar.
  - Verify your calls to `MyApp.of(context)?.toggleTheme(...)` in `home_screen.dart`.
